// CONCRETE LIST OF TODOs
Stability
    When loading in different thread, make sure the loading is killed when changing datasets.

Statistics

    Compute Histograms
    Plot Histograms
    Create Interface for groups and properties
    Implement Configure View Matrix
    Implement Controls for properties
        (Hierarchical?)
    Implement Periodic Control widget
    Implement Periodic Histograms

DensityVolume
    Compute Density Volume
    Implement RayCaster
Rendering
    ComputeOccupancy Volume (no need for spatial hash)
Application
    Fix data synchronization bugs between datasets
Platform
    Cross-platform DirListing (Prio mac and Win32)
        --- mac
        --- win32



// BIG PICTURE

Design principles:
    Data Oriented Design, try and avoid Object Orientation unless it is the better choice for some reason.
    C++11 / 14 with minimal dependencies.
    Avoid Templates unless necessary (example: Array might be a candidate for template).
    No STL, it is bulky and not really needed.
    Maintain interactivity!
    Keep low compile times!
    Move most functionality into stand alone header files like nothings stb libs

Target Platforms:
    Win32
    OSX 10.9+ (OpenGL 3.2? 3.3 / 4.1)
    Linux

License:
    MIT? Very permissive Open source

General:
    Small Math lib (SIMD) <- This should be realized, but for now use glm
        vec2
        vec3
        vec4
        mat2
        mat3
        mat4
        dot
        cross
        operators + - * /
    Array
    Allocator
    DynamicArray
    Hash CRC32/64 (Constexpr)

Platform layer:
    Move all GLFW into here (Window creation)
    OnFileChanged
    StoreFile
    ReadFile
    StoreCompressed (ZIP? STB?)
    ReadCompressed
    LoadImg
    StoreImg
    Provide IMGUI with optional define to enable disable

VIAMD:
    --- MENU BAR
    Load/Store Scene?

Molecule:
    Molecule structure
        Extra RenderingData ptr??? Not needed as a first step
    PDB (PDB Molecule struct?)
    GRO (GRO Molecule struct?)
    --- Multiframe PDB
    (Multiframe GRO? No)
    Utils:
        Backbone / Spline?

Trajectory:
    Trajectory structure
    'Stream trajectory'
        Have one thread that 'copies' binary-frame data from disk
        Another thread decompresses frames into trajectory
    Load trejectory in different thread but make the results immediately visible.

Representations:
    --- Port VDW
    --- Port Licorice
        --- Fix precision errors in Licorice
    --- Port Ribbons
        Fix Orientation problems

Rendering:
    ShaderLoading
    Camera (Perspective / Orto)
    CameraController (Trackball, FPS? Convenient swap between)
    VolumeRenderer
    SSAO
    HDR
    Tonemapping
    PBR
    Implicit Rendering?
        Surface?

Statistics:
    Revise structure
    ComputeHistogram
    ComputeAbsorptionSpectrum
    ComputeDensityVolume
    Port GUI
        Histograms Plots
        Timelines
        RangeSliders (Bugfixes)
