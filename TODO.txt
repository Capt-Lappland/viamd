CONCRETE LIST OF TODOs

### Stability ###
    [X] When loading in different thread, make sure the loading is killed when changing datasets.
    [ ] Visual bug when RangeSliders Float when range is zero
    [ ] Occasional crash on Mac???

### Performance ###
    [ ] Compute statistics async while loading frames
    [X] Compute backbone angles async while loading frames
    [ ] PDB-Loader: When data is multi-frame: Allocate overestimation of frames based of file size, then load traj async.

### Look & Feel ###
    [ ] Ramachandran
        [ ] Improve interface design
        [ ] Improve current frame plots, use Imgui?
    [X] Implement Minimize Representations or Hide Details somehow
    [X] On screen info on background operations (Loading data, Computing stats, etc.)

### Features ###
    [ ] Improved Line Plot Frame (Support selection of range(s?), Zoom, Axis, Grid, etc.)
        [X] Zoom in on current mouse coord
        [X] Pan
        [X] Range selection
        [X] X-axis
        [X] Y-axis
        [ ] (Grid)?
        [ ] Tooltip + Line
        [ ] Draw outline + transparent area
    ([ ] Implement Periodic Plot Frame)
        [ ] Range selection
        [ ] Tooltip + Line
        [ ] Draw current value as line
    [ ] Ramachandran
        [ ] Change to uint8
        [ ] Colormap with increasing lightness
        [ ] Expose different Color schemes
    [ ] Statistics
        [ ] Support frame range
        [ ] Support property filtering
    [ ] Volume Density Generation
    [ ] Volume RayCaster
    [ ] Transfer Function Design
    [ ] Occupancy Volume

// BIG PICTURE

Design principles:
    Data Oriented Design, try and avoid Object Orientation unless it is the better choice for some reason.
    C++11 / 14 with minimal dependencies.
    Avoid Templates unless necessary (example: Array might be a candidate for template).
    No STL, it is bulky and not really needed.
    Maintain interactivity!
    Keep low compile times!
    Move most functionality into stand alone header files like nothings stb libs

Target Platforms:
    Win32
    OSX 10.9+ (3.3 / 4.1)
    Linux

License:
    MIT? Very permissive Open source

General:
    Small Math lib (SIMD) <- This should be realized, but for now use glm
        vec2
        vec3
        vec4
        mat2
        mat3
        mat4
        dot
        cross
        operators + - * /
    Array
    Allocator
    DynamicArray
    Hash CRC32/64 (Constexpr)

Platform layer:
    [DONE] Move all GLFW into here (Window creation)
    [DONE] OpenFileDialog
    [DONE] SaveFileDialog
    EventSystem ???
    (OnFileChanged)
    StoreCompressed (ZIP? STB?)
    ReadCompressed
    LoadImg
    SaveImg
    Provide IMGUI with optional define to enable disable

VIAMD:
    [DONE] MENU BAR
    [DONE] Load/Store Scene?

Molecule:
    [DONE]   Molecule structure
    (Maybe!) Extra RenderingData ptr??? Not needed as a first step
    [DONE] PDB Loader
    [DONE] GRO Loader
    [DONE] XTC Loader
    [DONE] Multiframe PDB
    (Multiframe GRO? No)
    Utils:
    [DONE-ish]    Backbone / Spline?

Trajectory:
    Trajectory structure
    'Stream trajectory'
        Have one thread that 'copies' binary-frame data from disk
        Another thread decompresses frames into trajectory
    Load trejectory in different thread but make the results immediately visible.

Representations:
    --- Port VDW
    --- Port Licorice
        --- Fix precision errors in Licorice
    --- Port Ribbons
        Fix Orientation problems

Rendering:
    ShaderLoading
    Camera (Perspective / Orto)
    CameraController (Trackball, FPS? Convenient swap between)
    VolumeRenderer
    SSAO
    HDR
    Tonemapping
    PBR
    Implicit Rendering?
        Surface?

Statistics:
    Revise structure
    ComputeHistogram
    ComputeAbsorptionSpectrum
    ComputeDensityVolume
    Port GUI
        Histograms Plots
        Timelines
        RangeSliders (Bugfixes)
